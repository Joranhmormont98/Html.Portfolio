<h1>The Best Movies According to Eddie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. Christopher Nolan's movies are always 
    mesmerizing due to his use of time, but interstellar stnds out for
    me because it goes beyond SCI-FI and address the issue of love and
    sacrifice.</p>
<h3>The Irishman</h3>
<p>My favorite scorcese film of all time. The movie although an autobiography,
    touches on matters like love, betrayal and loyalty.
</p>
<h3>Thor: Ragnarok</h3>
<p>This was a breath of fresh air for the marvel universe, the humor in this 
    movie is second to none
